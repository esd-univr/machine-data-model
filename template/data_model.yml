data_model:
  # The data model is a tree of objects, each object can be a Variable, Method, Folder or Include.
  # The tree is rooted in a Folder object.
  # Folders can contain other Folders, Variables, Methods or Includes.
  # They are used to organize the machine data model.
  # Variables are the leaves of the tree, they contain the actual data.
  # Variables can be of two types: Variable or VariableObj.
  # VariableObj are Variables objects that contain other Variables (i.e., properties).
  # To avoid redundancy, VariableObj are included from other files with the !Include tag, defining the structure of the object.
  # Methods are used to define remote procedures that can be requested to the machine. (i.e., services)
  # The Include tag can also be used to include portions of the data model from other files.
